       <h2>Message</h2>
       <p> I know for me growing up as a teenager, I went through a phase where I did not appreciate school and did not do too well either. I would zone out in my core subject classes 
           and overall just didnâ€™t care. Back then for me, motivational school quotes    inspired me to persevere</p> -->
